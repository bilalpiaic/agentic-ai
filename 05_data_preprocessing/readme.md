# **Data Preprocessing**
This module provides an essential guide to data preprocessing, covering key libraries used for handling and preparing data for machine learning and deep learning models. Proper data preprocessing ensures better model accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.

## **Overview**
Data preprocessing is a critical step in any machine learning pipeline. It involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for modeling. This module includes the following libraries:

1. **NumPy** – Efficient numerical computation and array operations.
2. **Pandas** – Data manipulation and handling tabular data.
3. **OpenCV** – Image processing and computer vision preprocessing.
4. **Scikit-Learn** – Data transformation, feature scaling, and encoding for ML models.
