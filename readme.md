# Getting Started with Poetry and FastAPI

## Poetry Configuration and Installation

### Install Poetry
- Use the official installer for Poetry:
  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```
- On Windows (using PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
  ```

### Install Project Dependencies
- To install all dependencies for an already created project:
  ```bash
  poetry install --no-root
  ```

### Create a New Project
- To initialize a new Poetry project:
  ```bash
  poetry init
  ```

### Manage Dependencies
- To add a new dependency:
  ```bash
  poetry add <package-name>
  ```
- To remove a dependency:
  ```bash
  poetry remove <package-name>
  ```

## Installing FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Add FastAPI with standard dependencies:
  ```bash
  poetry add "fastapi[standard]"
  ```
- Add Uvicorn (ASGI server):
  ```bash
  poetry add uvicorn
  ```

## Running Files

### Run with Python
- Use `poetry run` to execute Python scripts:
  ```bash
  poetry run python <relative-path-to-file>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  poetry run python 07-llm-and-prompt-engineering/01_gemeni_llm.py
  ```

### Run with FastAPI/Uvicorn
- Use `poetry run` with Uvicorn to serve FastAPI applications:
  ```bash
  poetry run uvicorn <relative-path-to-module>:app --reload
  ```
  - Replace `/` with `.` in the path, and change `.py` to `:app`.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn 09-langgraph.websocket-agent.ws_agent_server_gemini:app --reload
    ```
