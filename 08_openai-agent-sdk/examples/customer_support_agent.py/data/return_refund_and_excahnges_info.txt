**Sample Information for "EcoHome Essentials" Chatbot: Returns, Refunds & Exchanges**

Welcome to the EcoHome Essentials Returns, Refunds & Exchanges section. We want you to be completely satisfied with your sustainable home goods. If for any reason you are not delighted with your purchase, we've outlined our straightforward policy to ensure a hassle-free experience. Our aim is to make returns as eco-friendly and convenient as possible.

**1. Our Return Policy Overview:**

* **What is your general return policy?**
    You may return most new, unused items in their original packaging within **30 days of delivery** for a full refund or exchange. Items must be in a re-sellable condition. Please note that certain items, as specified below, are exempt from our general return policy. We encourage you to review the product description carefully before purchasing.
* **What items are not eligible for return?**
    To maintain hygiene and product integrity, the following items are generally **not eligible for return** unless they arrive damaged or defective:
    * Personal care items (e.g., natural soaps, lotions, reusable menstrual products) if packaging is opened.
    * Intimate apparel or certain textile items if packaging is opened or tags removed, due to hygiene reasons.
    * Custom or personalized orders.
    * Gift cards.
    * Items marked as "Final Sale" or "Non-Returnable" on the product page.
    * Products that have been used, washed, or are not in their original, re-sellable condition.
    If you are unsure about a specific product's return eligibility, please check the product page or contact us before purchasing.
* **Do I need the original packaging to return an item?**
    Yes, items must be returned in their original, undamaged packaging, including any product tags, instruction manuals, or accessories. This ensures the product can be safely returned to our inventory and prevents further waste. If original packaging is missing or significantly damaged, a restocking fee may apply, or the return may be denied.
* **How long does it take to process a return and receive a refund?**
    Once your return is received and inspected at our warehouse, we will notify you via email of the approval or rejection of your refund. Approved refunds are typically processed within **5-7 business days** to your original payment method. The timing of the credit appearing on your statement may vary depending on your bank or credit card company.

**2. Initiating a Return:**

* **How do I start a return?**
    To initiate a return, please visit our "Returns Portal" on our website or contact our customer support team at returns@ecohomeessentials.com. You will need your order number and the email address used for the purchase.
    Follow the steps provided:
    1.  Select the item(s) you wish to return.
    2.  Specify the reason for the return.
    3.  You will be provided with a return shipping label and instructions on how to package and send back your item(s).
* **Who pays for return shipping?**
    * **If the return is due to our error** (e.g., you received an incorrect or defective item), we will provide a pre-paid return shipping label, and you will not be charged for return shipping.
    * **If the return is due to a change of mind or personal preference**, the customer is responsible for the return shipping costs. These costs will either be deducted from your refund amount or you will be required to purchase postage directly.
* **Where do I send my return?**
    Specific return instructions and the return address will be provided with your return shipping label generated through our Returns Portal. Please do not send items back to the original shipping address without following the official return process, as this may delay your refund.

**3. Refunds:**

* **How will I receive my refund?**
    Refunds are issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. This includes credit cards, PayPal, and Shop Pay. We cannot issue refunds to a different card or payment method.
* **What if I paid with a gift card?**
    If your purchase was made partially or fully with a gift card, the refunded amount corresponding to the gift card portion will be credited back to the original gift card.
* **Will my original shipping costs be refunded?**
    Original shipping charges are non-refundable, except in cases where the return is due to an error on our part (e.g., defective or incorrect item shipped). If you received free shipping on your original order and the return brings your order total below the free shipping threshold, the standard shipping cost for the retained items may be deducted from your refund.

**4. Exchanges:**

* **How do I exchange an item?**
    If you wish to exchange an item for a different size, color, or a completely different product, please initiate a return for the original item as outlined above. Once your return is processed and approved, you can then place a new order for the desired item on our website. This ensures that the item you want is in stock and shipped to you quickly.
* **What if the item I want to exchange for is a different price?**
    If the new item is of a different price, a refund will be issued for the original item, and you will be charged the new price for the exchanged item. We aim to make this process as seamless as possible.

**5. Damaged or Defective Items:**

* **What if my item arrived damaged or defective?**
    We take great care in packaging our products, but occasionally items can be damaged in transit or arrive with a manufacturing defect. If your item arrives damaged or defective, please contact our customer support team immediately within **48 hours of delivery**.
    * **Do not return the item without contacting us first.**
    * **Please provide clear photos of the damaged or defective item and its packaging.** This helps us with our quality control and claims process with the shipping carrier.
    * Upon verification, we will promptly arrange for a replacement to be sent to you at no additional charge, or issue a full refund, including original shipping costs. We may also arrange for the damaged item to be returned at our expense.

**6. Late or Missing Refunds:**

* **I haven't received my refund yet. What should I do?**
    If you've received an email notification that your refund has been processed, but you haven't seen it appear on your statement:
    1.  **Check your bank account again.**
    2.  **Contact your credit card company.** It may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Processing times vary.
    3.  **Contact your bank.** There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
    If you've completed all these steps and you still have not received your refund after 10 business days from our refund confirmation email, please contact us at support@ecohomeessentials.com, and we will investigate further.

**7. Special Circumstances:**

* **What if I received a gift and need to return it?**
    If you received an EcoHome Essentials item as a gift and need to return it, please contact our customer support team. If you have the order number or the original purchaser's email, we can arrange for a store credit to be issued for the value of the return. If the gift giver wishes to initiate the return for a refund to their original payment method, they will need to do so directly.
* **What if I return an item outside the 30-day window?**
    Returns requested or received after the 30-day return window may be subject to a restocking fee or may not be accepted. We reserve the right to refuse returns that do not meet our policy criteria.

We value your business and are committed to ensuring your satisfaction with EcoHome Essentials. Our return policy is designed to be fair, transparent, and in line with our commitment to sustainable practices. If you have any questions or require assistance with a return, our dedicated support team is always ready to help.
